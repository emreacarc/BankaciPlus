# 🏦 Bankaci Plus: AI-Powered Banking Decision Support System

I'm excited to share **Bankaci Plus**, a comprehensive Data-Driven Decision Support System that integrates three critical banking verticals into a single intelligent platform powered by advanced ML algorithms.

## 🎯 What It Does

**Bankaci Plus** addresses real banking challenges:
- **Credit Risk Analysis:** Real-time default risk assessment using XGBoost (Lite: 70.31%, Pro: 71.24% ROC-AUC)
- **Churn Prevention:** Predictive customer retention with personalized strategies using LightGBM (86%+ ROC-AUC, 50-fold CV)
- **Next Best Action:** Intelligent product recommendations via K-Means segmentation (6 customer segments)

## 🚀 Key Highlights for Employers

**Production-Ready Implementation:**
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud with live demo
- Full-stack development from data preprocessing to web interface
- Robust error handling, model persistence, and version control

**Advanced ML Engineering:**
- Systematic model comparison (XGBoost vs LightGBM vs CatBoost) with 50-fold cross-validation
- Hyperparameter optimization using RandomizedSearchCV (150 combinations tested)
- Feature engineering: loan-to-income ratios, PTI, balance-to-income ratios
- Extensive validation: 50-fold CV for churn, 3-fold CV for credit risk

**Real-World Data & Performance:**
- 40,000+ real loan records (Lending Club dataset 2007-2015)
- 10,000 customer records with churn labels
- Performance: 86%+ accuracy in churn prediction, 70%+ ROC-AUC for credit risk
- Actionable insights: risk scores, retention strategies, product recommendations

**Technical Stack:**
- **ML:** XGBoost, LightGBM, scikit-learn (K-Means, preprocessing pipelines)
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, OneHotEncoder
- **Frontend:** Streamlit with custom CSS, Plotly interactive visualizations
- **DevOps:** Git/GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, production deployment

## 📊 What This Demonstrates

This project showcases:
- **End-to-end ML pipeline** development (from data to deployment)
- **Model selection expertise** (systematic algorithm comparison)
- **Production-ready coding** (scalability, UX, error handling)
- **Business understanding** (solving real fintech challenges)
- **Technical depth** (hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, cross-validation)
- **Communication skills** (bilingual documentation, clear visualizations)
